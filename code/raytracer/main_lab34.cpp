 * I've put a lot of time and effort into this code. For the last decade
 * it's been used to introduce hundreds of students at multiple universities
 * to raytracing. It forms the basis of your coursework but you are free
 * to continue using/developing forever more. However, I ask that you don't
 * share the code or your derivitive versions publicly. In order to continue
 * to be used for coursework and in particular assessment it's important that
 * versions containing solutions are not searchable on the web or easy to
 * download.
 *
 * If you want to show off your programming ability, instead of releasing
 * the code, consider generating an incredible image and explaining how you
 * produced it.
